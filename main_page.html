             <h2>Hiking</h2>
             <p>From leisurely rambles to invigorating hikes, Cape Town has something for everyone.</p>

             <p>Whether you’re after a windswept coastal wander, a mountainous hike with spectacular views, or a leisurely amble through one of the Cape’s lush nature reserves, here’s our pick of the best hiking trails in and around the city. So, lace up your hiking boots and get cracking… And, let us know your thoughts in the comments below.</p>

             <p><h4>Important note</h4> <i>Although the Cape is rich in natural beauty, tourists and locals are urged to take necessary precautions when exploring secluded areas, as crimes and accidents do happen.
             Those venturing into the Table Mountain National Park should have the following emergency numbers on hand: 086 110 6417/ 107 or 021 480 7700. Criminal incidents should be reported to the nearest police station as soon as able.
             We also recommend @safetymountain as a useful resource for hikers. This free safety tracking service allows you to notify local trackers of your contact details, intended route and travel time via whatsapp. You are then able to provide hourly updates on your progress, and to notify trackers when you are safely off the mountain.</p></i>

             <p>It helps to have a map, and for that, SANParks and The Inside Guide recommends Slingsby Maps as an essential resource for hiking enthusiasts. Detailed maps of some of the Cape’s best hiking trails are available, including the Pipe Track, Cape Point and the Cederberg. Contact Slingsby Maps at 021 788 4545 for more information.</p>

             <h2>Fishing</h2>
             <p>Before we share some of our top picks for fishing spots, it’s important to note a few details. Recreational fishing is regulated by bag limits. In order to fish in fresh water or the ocean, you will need a recreational fishing permit. These can be obtained at post offices across the city. If you’re taking a fishing charter, permits will be organised on your behalf. Charters to check out include Cape Fishing, False Bay Charters, Hooked on Africa and Big Blue Fishing Charters to name just a few. Make sure that you do your homework to find out what species are prohibited and which ones are cool to catch. For more info on permits, you can contact CapeNature on +27 (0)21 483 0000.</p>

             <p>While you’re out on the water, be sure to avoid littering. Don’t ever throw fishing line away – this can kill birds and other creatures. Keep a waste bag to use for all of your litter, and always make sure that you enjoy the environment responsibly to protect it for future generations.</p>

             <p>Freshwater fishing spots in Cape Town include a variety of lakes, rivers and dams including peaceful fly fishing. It is often a good choice for beginners as well as anglers who prefer to catch and release. Species typically found in freshwater locations includes carp, trout and bass. Some of the freshwater fishing spots in Cape Town that you can consider include the following:</p>
